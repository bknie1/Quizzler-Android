# Quizzler-Android
This was inspired by a project in an Android Native Udemy course. Originally, the prompt was the follow the tutorial, but because it was aimed at newer programmers, I decided to pursue the prompt on my own. The tutorial video featured "bad smells" such as repetitive code. Instead of following the tutorial, I watched the opening video and tried to recreate the end result on my own with little guidance.
